            <p class="pb-2 text-lg">
              We look into two tools that help you realize if something is off and pinpoint what you can do about it. Map out your values, learn a powerful framework to check in with yourself on your own concerns instead of letting emotional background processing drain your energy, and use easy-to-learn counseling techniques to gain an outside perspective that helps you see new paths towards solving issues that come up along the way.

            <p class="pb-2 text-lg">
              What are you trying to promote with your work and what conditions do you need to ensure that you can do so? Apply essentialist thinking to find out and set extreme decision criteria to protect your focus and make your life easier for choices that really matter to you. For those goals that need consistency in following through, it is key to develop and shape new good habits. Learn from your brain’s perspective how to build the habits that support you in doing your best work day by day.

            <p class="pb-2 text-lg">
              Sometimes the magic is in the “Yes, and…” – and sometimes a “No” will empower you more. Based on the values and projects you identified earlier in the year, learn how to say “No” in a way that helps you steer your course and reaffirm what you are after while gently declining projects that distract you from that goal. Sometimes things are not so clear-cut and you may want to keep options open, but smartly. Thus we learn to apply a technique that helps you identify measures that empower both sides on seemingly irreconcilable questions.

            <p class="pb-2 text-lg">
              The end of the year is an excellent time to reflect on what you have achieved and how to set course for your next endeavors. Learn to do so by inquiring your goals appreciatively and building on your strengths. Empower yourself by identifying and leaning into the types of work that drive up your motivation and energy levels. More power to those tasks and goals that power you!

          FAQ

          <strong>
            What if I have a conflicting appointment?
          </strong><br>
          Bookings are binding. You can ask to attend a Masterclass / Booster Session on a different day if you have a scheduling conflict during one of the sessions in a series.
          Please use this option sparingly, as we want to keep classes small to enhance learning.

        </p>

          <strong>
            Can I access a recording of the class later?
          </strong><br>
          Inputs by Dr. Maier will be recorded and can be accessed afterwards. Interactive individual and group work will not be recorded and we work under Chatham House Rule: Learnings and take aways can not be attributed to specific persons.
