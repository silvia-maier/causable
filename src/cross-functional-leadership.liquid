          This is a hands-on practical course for those who want to move from silos to cross-functional teams and would like to onboard both the designated leaders and the team to a new mode of working together to deliver outcomes for a certain value stream.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          How can you create a product or innovative solution with a cross-functional team? Which roles & expertises do you need on your team, how do you know whether individuals fit, and how to help them make an impact towards the common goal?
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          We are talking basics of building and guiding those teams, defining roles and responsibilities, building and prioritizing a roadmap, holding each other accountable to deliver outcomes and learn how to use tools to improve team cognitions so that all members know what to expect from each other and that they can rely on each other.
