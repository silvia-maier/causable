          Have you been part of meetings that dragged on forever, but achieved little in the end? In this course, you will learn how you can use established facilitation methods to enable good communication and collaboration in teams, particularly if collaborators  work in projects, cross-functional and have different backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          The only prerequisite for this course? You are willing to step up and lead.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          The methods you will learn help to enhance fruitful collaboration regardless whether you are in a formal leadership position or not. They are designed to integrated diverse perspectives from collaborators with different backgrounds and experiences, and can help to find solutions that are acceptable without making a weak compromise between parties with opposing views.

        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          This course will help prepare you for working in modern business and research and development environments, in which leadership more and more has become a distributed function in teams of experts with different backgrounds.
