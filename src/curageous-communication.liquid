          Some issues just are hairy and some environments are harder to navigate than the textbook suggests. Or as an international leader once put it in our conversation: „The idea of the Harvard concept to negotiate based on interests not positions and to be gentle to humans but firm about the cause is a nice aspiration – but I’ve rarely seen it used in practice when the stakes are high.“
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          What to do about this? How can you keep your personal values and integrity intact, while at the same time acknowledging the needs of the situation in which others also push for their preferred solution without starting to mutually explore the problem space together with you?
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          Generating solutions in such situations is protracted, and more often than not, you won’t be in a position to remedy the circumstances as such. But there are ways to keep your integrity and at the sime time find your way through this maze, acknowledging the needs and interests of others in this situation and broker viable solutions that don’t end up in a foul compromise.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          This course is for those who say „I don’t want to lead people because it’s all politics“, but who feel the itch that they actually would like to be heard in their collaborations. And for those, who would like to get heard as subject matter experts in political advisory situations.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 text-lg max-w-xl">
          Your impetus is right: when you are invited, your voice deserves to be heard in the room, because your perspective is needed. This course is meant to equip you with the tools to be prepared, so you can be courageous and have these conversations. Together, we work on the form, stance, and tools how to make your point productively and foster mutual learning, even in adverse circumstances.
